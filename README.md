# Bento Site

Welcome, Bento Site is a project that uses the bento layout to display pages of content.

Each page is in the bento layout with a highlighted section in the middle and other sections smaller and around the edges.

A user can click on a smaller section and will be routed to a new page in the bento layout with the smaller section the previously clicked on now becoming the highlighted section in the middle.
